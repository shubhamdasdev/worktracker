# WorkTracker API Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines a plan to enhance the WorkTracker app by integrating two external APIs that would add valuable functionality without disrupting the existing codebase. The current app functions entirely offline, storing shift data locally using Room database.

## Proposed APIs

### 1. Weather API (OpenWeatherMap)

#### Purpose
Integrate weather data to provide contextual information for work shifts, which can be useful for:
- Outdoor workers to plan their shifts around weather conditions
- Documenting weather-related impacts on productivity
- Providing weather context in shift reports

#### Implementation Plan
1. **Setup Phase**
   - Register for a free API key at OpenWeatherMap
   - Add the API key to local.properties (gitignored)
   - Add Retrofit and OkHttp dependencies to build.gradle

2. **API Integration**
   - Create a `network` package with:
     - Data models for weather responses
     - Retrofit service interface
     - API client singleton

3. **Feature Implementation**
   - Add a weather widget to the Clock screen
   - Include weather data in shift records
   - Display weather conditions in shift reports

4. **User Experience**
   - Add weather permission to AndroidManifest.xml
   - Create settings toggle to enable/disable weather feature
   - Implement graceful fallback when offline

### 2. Cloud Backup API (Firebase Firestore)

#### Purpose
Provide users with a way to back up their shift data to the cloud, ensuring:
- Data persistence across device changes
- Recovery from accidental data loss
- Optional multi-device synchronization

#### Implementation Plan
1. **Setup Phase**
   - Create a Firebase project
   - Add Firebase configuration to the app
   - Add Firebase Firestore dependencies

2. **Authentication**
   - Implement a simple authentication system
   - Create a user-friendly login/signup screen
   - Store authentication state securely

3. **Data Synchronization**
   - Create a sync service to upload shift data
   - Implement conflict resolution strategy
   - Add background sync with WorkManager

4. **User Experience**
   - Add backup/restore options in settings
   - Create sync status indicators
   - Implement privacy controls for user data

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture Changes
- Introduce a repository pattern that can switch between local and remote data sources
- Add a network layer with proper error handling and retry logic
- Implement a synchronization manager to handle data conflicts

### Security Considerations
- Secure API keys using BuildConfig or encrypted storage
- Implement proper authentication for Firebase
- Ensure user data privacy with clear opt-in controls

### Performance Impact
- Lazy-load weather data only when needed
- Schedule cloud backups during idle time or Wi-Fi connectivity
- Implement data compression for network transfers

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Preparation (1-2 weeks)
- Research and finalize API selection
- Set up development environment with API keys
- Create necessary data models and interfaces

### Phase 2: Weather API Integration (2-3 weeks)
- Implement network layer
- Create weather UI components
- Add weather data to shift records

### Phase 3: Cloud Backup Integration (3-4 weeks)
- Set up Firebase integration
- Implement authentication
- Create backup/restore functionality

### Phase 4: Testing and Refinement (2 weeks)
- Conduct thorough testing of API integrations
- Optimize performance and battery usage
- Refine user experience based on feedback

## Conclusion
These API integrations will significantly enhance the WorkTracker app while maintaining its core functionality. The weather API will provide contextual information for shifts, while the cloud backup API will ensure data safety and cross-device accessibility. Both implementations will be optional features that users can enable or disable according to their preferences.
